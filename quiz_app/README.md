# Quiz_app
English quiz app for learning new words (LT version).

The app was made using modern front end technologies like: webpack (JavaScript module bundler), ES6 (ECMAScript 2015 standard) scss (css extention language), BEM (naming methodology) and modular JavaScript code.

The quiz app contains 4 stages: index (before the game begins), playing (answering the questions), result (getting the result), checking answers (checking the correct answers if mistakes were made).

You can try it at: https://mindaras.github.io/quiz_app/.
